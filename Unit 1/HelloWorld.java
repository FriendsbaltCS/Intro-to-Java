// All java programs are made up of classes. A class can be

	// A Java program is separated into methods, which are
	// blocks of code that accomplish an individual task.
	// In order to run a java program it must have a method
	// that begins with "public static void main(String[] args).
	// The code that the method runs is enclosed between curly
	// braces as below. We'll cover what all these words mean
	// throughout the course.
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		// This bit of code tells the computer to type something
		// to the command line.
		System.out.println("Goodbye, Mars!");
		
	} //Curly braces end the body of a method.
	
} // Just like methods, the body of a class ends with a curly brace.
