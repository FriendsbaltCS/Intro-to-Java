# Lesson I.1 #


In this lesson we work together to create your first program in Java.
Please be sure to follow all instructions on MyFriends to install the
newest JDK on your home machine.

## Initial Setup ##

To begin, please follow these steps:

1. Create a working directory called "HelloWorld" somewhere on your home machine.
(A good idea would be in a Google Drive folder or flash drive so that you can access
it at school as well).

2. Download the file `HelloWorld.java` from the Unit 1 repository and save it to
your working directory.

3. Open a command prompt and navigate to the working directory by typing
`cd "path-to-working-directory"` (with your filepath of course).

4. Run the command `javac HelloWorld.java`. This will compile the program.

5. Finally, type the command `java HelloWorld` and press enter.

## Assignment ##

After you complete step 5 above, notice what is printed out to the command line.
For this program, you should edit the code so that it prints out the phrase
"Hello, World!"

Please also read the comments in the code for more information about how to build
a java program from scratch.

When you are finished, upload your project to Codepost. Don't forget to check the
results of the tests codepost will run and edit your program.

This (very short) assignment is worth **10 points** towards your final grade.
